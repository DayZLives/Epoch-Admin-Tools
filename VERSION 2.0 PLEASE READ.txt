This is the very early stage development of Epoch Admin Tool v2.0
Please bare in mind that v1.9.2 is still in the testing phase so this version will contain many un-finished and un-tested features.

We appreciate everyone's help in testing this tool, but please read the known issues before posting bug reports on the forum.

KNOWN ISSUES:
On first load the dialog will not be populated, just close the menu and open it again.
The spawn menu filter buttons are only partially implemented. The filters for the weapons, gear and buildings do not work.
The spawn skin menu needs more filtering. Some unusable base skins still in there.
The map markers for the modular built items do not work (from GUI).
The teleport in vehicle scripts may not work.
The remove gear script only works on admin at the moment.
The add ammo, spawn gear and spawn weapon scripts only work on admin at the moment.
The heal player script only works for the admin (from GUI).
Vehicle godmode may stay on after you exit the vehicle.
Admin scroll menu toggle is not always in-sync with the GUI.
